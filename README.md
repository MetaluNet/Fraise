[ **FRAISE** ](https://github.com/MetaluNet/Fraise) : <b>FRA</b>mework for <b>I</b>nterfacing <b>S</b>oftware and <b>E</b>lectronics

--------------------------------

**Fraise** is :


-	a protocol for communication between microcontrollers
-	some conventions about the communication physical layers and associated connectors 
-	a multi-platform integrated development and runtime environment hosted by [Pure Data](www.puredata.info) for microcontroller boards

Fraise boards are currently powered by Microchip's PIC18F26K22 8-bit microcontrollers, which have similar capabilities to Arduino's ATmega328.  
Compilation of the firmware is done with [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net) and [gputils](http://gputils.sourceforge.net); Fraise ships with the compiler's binaries for Linux-x86, Windows and OSX (Linux-arm to come), and automates from Pd all the compilation and upload processes.

##dependencies :

PureData + externals :

-	zexy
-	moonlib 
-	hcs 
-	ggee 
-	comport

On 64 bit linux, the compiler requires 32 bit compatibility libraries.
On Debian-like do :   
`sudo apt-get install libc6-i386`   
`sudo apt-get install lib32stdc++6`

##installation :

Install Pd + externals (or pd-extended). Get [deken](https://github.com/pure-data/deken) if it is not already installed, to be able to download latest versions of the externals.

Download latest Fraise version from Github : <https://github.com/MetaluNet/Fraise/archive/master.zip>.

Extract the archive somewhere, declare this path into Pd preferences.

On Linux, you may need to add your user to the dialout group, 
to have read/write permissions on the USB device /dev/ttyACM0. Just do :   
`sudo adduser [your_username] dialout`   
then logout and re-login.



##examples :

Open `fruit/example/exampleFruit.pd` with Pd.

##documentation :

Fraise library is generated by [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/), and is published there : http://metalunet.github.io/Fraise-doc

--------------------------------

# [**Fraise**](https://github.com/MetaluNet/Fraise) is:


-	a protocol establishing a communication between multiple micro-controller boards and a host computer
-	a C firmware library implementing the Fraise protocol plus various hardware-specific modules
-	a integrated multi-platform environment hosted by [Pure Data](http://www.puredata.info) (Pd) for interacting with Fraise boards

Fraise boards are currently powered by Microchip's PIC18F26K22 8-bit microcontrollers, which have similar capabilities to Arduino's ATmega328.  

The Fraise protocol is based on asynchronous serial communication. Thanks to a carefully selected, moderate bitrate (250 kbs), the micro-controller boards can be located hundreds of meter away from the computer (400 meters total bus length), when connected through RS485 transceivers (called Fraiseivers).  


The firmware is compiled with [SDCC](http://sdcc.sourceforge.net) and [gputils](http://gputils.sourceforge.net); Fraise ships with the compiler's binaries, and automates all the compilation and flashing processes from the Pd patches.

--------------------------------

## installation:

Fraise requires Pure Data version 0.54 or later.

Fraise can be installed through the built-in Pd externals installer, aka Deken (menu Help/Find externals).  

On Linux, you may need to authorize your user to use the USB serial devices; just type in a terminal:<br>
`sudo adduser [your_username] dialout`

then logout (close your session) and re-login.

## dependencies:

Fraise relies on two externals, which bring functionalities that are not (yet) supported by Pd natively:

-	ggee/shell, or motex/system on Windows, to allow execution of a batch file
-	comport, to access USB serial devices

These externals are included in the Fraise distribution for most platforms, so you shouldn't have to install anything.


## examples:

Open `fruit/example/exampleFruit.pd` with Pd.

## documentation:

The documentation for the Fraise firmware library is generated by [doxygen](http://www.stack.nl/~dimitri/doxygen/), and is published there: http://metalunet.github.io/Fraise-doc
